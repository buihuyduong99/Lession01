                            <p>By the end of this responsive CSS tutorial you will end up with something similar to the page above.
                            It is very plain design, but it will do the trick for now. It is fairly easy to clone the image as seen above, 
                            but the main goal the here is to make it responsive. To make the website repond based on the size of your device's screen size. </p>
                            <p> Our goal is to create a website which has the basic areas of a website: header, body, sidebar, and footer. Of course, everything will be responsive , form images down to text and elements placement.</p>
